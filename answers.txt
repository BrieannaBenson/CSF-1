Reflection:

My favorite assignment so far. Math has never been my strongest point, and it seemed the previous assignmnets required us to just figure out formulas etc... which I see the use in however this section let us get into code and disect it. Playing with it and seeing what happens when we tweek small things, I feel is a much more intuitive way to learn.
