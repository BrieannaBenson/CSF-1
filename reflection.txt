Reflection:

This has prooven to be very challanging. I have a few of parts more or less figured out,
the problem I run into is getting it to fit in I guess. That is I know parts of what I need
to do, or at least I think I do, but I am struggeling on how to impliment it. So instead of 
having just part of a code, I have little pieces of parts of code with no where to put them. This is
why the sheet looks so blank despite my efforts.
