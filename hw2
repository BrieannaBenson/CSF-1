# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.


###
### Problem 1
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

n = 100
total = 0
i = 1
while i <= n :
	total = total + i
	i = i +1
print total


###
### Problem 2
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

T = range( 2, 11 )
for i in T:
	print 1.0/i


###
### Problem 3
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in range ( 1, n + 1 ):
	triangular = triangular +1
print triangular
print n*(n+1)/2

###
### Problem 4
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

n = 10 
total = 1
for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :
total = total * i
print total

###
### Problem 5
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

n = 10
while n > 0 :
	total = 1
	for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :
		total = total * i
	print total
	n = n - 1

###
### Problem 6
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

n = 1
totalb = 1.0
while n <= 10 :
	total = 1
	for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :
		total = total * 1
	totalb = totalb + ( 1.0 / total )
	n = n + 1
print totalb

### Collaboration
###

# Ian Hooper helped correct a couple things I overlooked. 


###
### Reflection
###

# Assignment took about 3 hours spread out over a few days but overall
# I feel class helped provide me with I needed to complete it, I had to 
# refrence notes a bit to help remember formulas etc... but overall I feel
# competent enough from the class provided information.
